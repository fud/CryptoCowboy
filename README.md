A live working sample can be found here: http://computercowboy.tech/

This is all my raw data dumped. It has not been cleaned up or organized so it's not meant to be used in its current form. It's for people who want to sift through my code for ideas or sample code.

Use at your own risk. I will be cleaning it up over the next few weeks. I recomend not running this unless you understand what every line of code is doing. It is not ready to be operated in it's current condition.

I've been doing a lot of work testing a new algorithim for some last minute changes, but once that's complete, I will start packaging up this software nicely. It need's more testing to ensure there are no problems.

TODO:

• Clean up useless comments. Add more useful comments.

• Place more logic into functions

• Create modules to separate function types
